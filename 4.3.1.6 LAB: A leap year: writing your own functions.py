# Scenario
# Your task is to write and test a function which takes one argument (a year) and returns True if the year is a leap year,

# or False otherwise.

# The seed of the function is already shown in the skeleton code in the editor.

# Note: we've also prepared a short testing code, which you can use to test your function.

# The code uses two lists â€’ one with the test data, and the other containing the expected results. 

# The code will tell you if any of your results are invalid.

def isLeapYear(year):
	# if the year is divisible by 4 and NOT divisible by 100 
    # OR if the year is divisible by 400 and AND is divisible by 100 
    if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0 and year % 100 == 0):
        return True
    else:
        return False






test_data = [1900, 2000, 2016, 1987]
test_results = [False, True, True, False]
for i in range(len(test_data)):
	yr = test_data[i]
	print(yr,"->",end="")
	result = isLeapYear(yr)
	if result == test_results[i]:
		print("OK")
	else:
		print("Failed")
