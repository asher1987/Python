# Scenario
# Your task is to write and test a function which takes one argument (a year) and returns True if the year is a leap year,

# or False otherwise.

# The seed of the function is already shown in the skeleton code in the editor.

# Note: we've also prepared a short testing code, which you can use to test your function.

# The code uses two lists â€’ one with the test data, and the other containing the expected results. 

# First Condition: It is a leap year if it is divisible by 4. 
# Second Condition: It is a leap year if it is NOT (!) divisible by 100
# Third Condition: It is a leap year if it is divisible by 400
# If none of the conditions are met, it is NOT a leap year

def isLeapYear(year):
	if year % 4 == 0:
		return True
	elif year % 100 != 0:
		return True
	elif year % 400 == 0:
		return True
	else:
		return False

	print(yr,"->",end="")
	result = isLeapYear(yr)
	if result == test_results[i]:
		print("OK")
	else:
		print("Failed")
